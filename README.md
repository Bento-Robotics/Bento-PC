# Bento-PC
Set up bash shell for [Bento_Operation](https://github.com/bento-robotics/Bento-Operation) 
Script for dynamic and automatic workspace name changing via the wireless LAN of the respective robot. 
Mostly for time saving and annoyance reduction.
The script itself get the name of the WLAN and returns it to the function that then checks for a corresponding name in the file and then changes the workspace to the corresponding robot if it matches the WLAN name.
